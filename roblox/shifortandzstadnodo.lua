-[[ This script will first identify the player, then after establishing the tweening service of roblox, will play a special sound and create a new cylinder with the localplayer as its parent, it then identifies the parameters for tweening service and then establishes it and now it will play.
This script can be used in some sort of dragon ball game or something idk tbh it really just depends anyway let's see how it works when I get back home. "Twi" will be adjusted and modified later on, but for now it will stay that way, hopefully one day reverting to multiline parameters
