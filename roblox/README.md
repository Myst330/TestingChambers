#ROBLOX

Yeha guys this folder here is for my roblox projects or rather it was for my roblox projects cause I forgot to commit them and so now they're all gone imagine that months of progress and work just to disappear cause I forgot to save but yeah like I said previously it's my problem I hope I learn from it finally (this 100% isn't the first time) and so I'm probably gonna have to relearn lua cause I don't even have any references at least from what I used to do all I have are pictures and copy+pastes from my own code and I don't want to open w3 schools again it's painful I don't even thikn I learned lua from w3 schools so I'm good there I don't think I'm in a bad position but still like guys you know alright let me tell you a story of my trip to the Philippines alright we went to this farm thing called enchantefarm which is basically just a farm but not the type you're thikning about I mean most people would imagine like a barn or something but this one is kinda like a cottage in the mdidle of the woods with a nice pond with devil geese that bit me by the way and it's really nice there cause it also has a pool right so I haven't swam in approximately 3 years but it would be my first time swimming in that time so on the morning I ate my breakfast and then rested a bit cause you're not supposed to swim or bathe right after eating and then I jumped in right and luckily I was tall enough to not have to swim at the deepest level of the pool but when I jumped in there I fully expected myself to completely remember to swim but I just didn't and it was stunning and I mean I felt ashamed of myself like how did I forget to swim in 3 years I mean given I was sick and last time I swam my body was different and my attire was much more hydrodynamic but still I can't believe that I couldn't even float or even move in the water I kinda just flailed and you know that really struck something in me and I hated it the feeling of forgetting but I then realized that it was not the fact that I didn't know how to swim that triggered me but the fact that I was not able to do something I and everyone was expecting me to be able to do with good intention. I had not failed an expectation for as long as I could remember, and that was probably the first time. I was ashamed, truly, and I realized that I was just not able to swim anymore. I hated the feeling, as one would, and I vowed to test if I had forgotten anything else. You see I, and probably many others, have this impulse to become the best at anything they try at, when they try, but you see, I am physically incapable of not trying/putting effort into something like I just cannot even though my life was on the line or even though it was for a joke which is why I'm bad with comedy and a lot of other different things - I just try too hard and so it awakened my drive to become the best swimmer in the country but of course as most things come and go my drive had worn out quickly and I forgot about it and of course this was around about 2 weeks ago so not very long ago but now I feel fear instead of the confidence I once had for if someone had fallen and drowned in the time that I thought I could swim when I couldn't, and I jumped in there to save them, thinking I could swim, I would not forgive myself, which is why even though I no longer have motivation to become the best, I do feel it is necessary to learn how or else I will suffer for my ignorance. Anyway yeah this folder is for roblox stuff and roblox stuff only cause if I make any more stuff other than the folders I already have can contain then I'll just make new folders.
