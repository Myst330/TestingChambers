# TestingChambers
Welcome to the Aperture Science Testing Initiative Training Center or something like that. 
<br>
Me bored and I have to work on something to ease the boredom and I also want to improve my skills without anyone interfering (finally) so this is cool and abyss is cool and everything is cool and so I'm gonna use these testing chambers to essentially make all sorts of projects and delete them after they work cause I can't make a cpp project and html in the same thing so uh yeah anyway let's go.
