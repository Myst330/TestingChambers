#bypass

First folder you see. idk if this is gonna make it out because I don't know if I'm gonna remember to commit it
it's pretty much unblockers that I tested during school to see if they worked / how well they worked and yeah they work
it's just that they don't work in the way I initially expected since I mean it unblocks the site but it doesn't unblock the site within the site or rather the unblocker unintentionally blocks the site within the site. either that
or it's just the former because I mean it worked last time it's just that it doesn't block the inside site which means we don't get the actual cool movie thing we only get tthe stuff around it and so it pretty much doesn't work but at least it works as it was intended to it's just not working enough but it's fine because it's not their problem it's my problem so I just have to find a way to work around it. Thanki hyou for listening to my TEDTalk.
